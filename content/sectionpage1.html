<p>R Markdown files for govuk-hugo do not need an output format specified. Remember that you should not knit these files directly, instead use <code>build_govuk_hugo()</code> to process these files and incorporate them with the <code>govuk-hugo</code> theme.</p>
<p>Set the <code>section</code> in the YAML header to the sub-directory of the main content folder that you would like the processed page to exist in.</p>
<p>A default <code>weight</code> of 100 is set, change this to alter how pages are sorted in the navigation bar.</p>
<p>It is recommended to provide a <code>summary</code> in the YAML header to make page lists easily readable.</p>
